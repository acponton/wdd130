    <h2>Andy</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Andrea. I was born and raised in Guayaquil, Ecuador 
    but currently been living in Illinois for over 3 years. I am married and I have 
    2 children, Natalia (14) and Adam (3).</p>
    <p>I am a student of BYU-IDAHO pursuing BS in Applied Technology. I got an Accounting 
    and Audit Degree in my country, but I wanted to start another knowledge path here 
    in this country that's why I chose Web and Computer Programming because I want to 
    be able to choose Database for my next certificate.</p>
    <p>Nice to meet everyone!</p>

      <h4>Rivers</h4>
      <p>This page is to give information about the rivers that the company runs.</p>
      <h5>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h5>
      <P>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was 
        given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the 
        number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</P>
      <P>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also 
        commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over 
        the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</P>
      <P>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed 
        rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the 
        early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...
        but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</P>
      <h6>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h6>
      <P>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows 
        towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids 
        have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
        and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, 
        and great whitewater opportunities.</P>
      <h7>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</h7>
      <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and 
        rich history that the canyon tells.</p>
      <h8>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h8>
      <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit 
        to the Grand Canyon.</p>
      <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly 
        unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with 
        side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
      <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
        rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people 
        are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

      <h3>Enjoying Outdoors</h3>
      <p> Spending time outside the serenity one is used to have positive effects on the physical and the mental health. 
        Research shows that spending leisure time in those activities not confined to your area improves both the 
        physical and mental well-being.</p>
      <p>Outdoor activities includes walking, fishing, running, playing, mountain hiking, biking, horseback riding, 
        boating and fishing, kayaking, picnicking and swimming. It is also healthy to spend time in nature settings for 
        example watching the rivers flowing, adventuring the forests and game parks (Sisson 1).</p>
      <p>Research proves that engaging in outdoor activities is significant to the growth and development of the body 
        and the mind. However, this can be achieved through other means like indoors, but with a lot of trouble and expenses.</p>

      <h3>The beauty of the nature.</h3>
      <p> When was the last time you had a complete interaction with nature? Do you still remember the last time you 
        witnessed the sunrise or the sunset or how the ocean’s waves splashed on the seashore?</p>
      <p>If you can’t remember the last time you had your full attention to nature, then this is a hint that you need
        to take a break, spend some time outdoors, and savor the beautiful canvas of nature. Being able to see, 
        appreciate, and inhale the beauty of nature can be fun, relaxing, and peaceful. When you’re constantly 
        interacting with nature, your stress levels are reduced regardless of what age you are. That’s because when 
        nature’s beauty surrounds you, your brain becomes free of distractions. It will solely focus on the alluring sight, 
        which then relaxes you in return.</p>
      <p>Moreover, spending more time with nature promotes your active imagination and puts you at inner peace.</p>
